# Setup Your Gitpod Workspace

This documentation contains setup instruction for the usage of this Gitpod template built by your friend sat the Pins team.

## Method 1: Remix-Then-Deploy Way
We recommend following this step so anyone can code locally while some will 

* [**Remix the template first.**](https://gitlab.com/deploy2gitpod-templates/nodejs-starter/-/forks/new) This will lessen the extra work on the workspace console once you hit **Open in GitPod** button.
* **Edit the files locally or in GitLab/GitHub.** And when everything is ready, push to the Git repo of your fork.
* **Once ready, deploy to Gitpod and start coding!** Prefix `https://gitpod.io#` before your GitHub/GitLab repo link, sign in when prompted and volia!

## Method 2: Deploy First Then Remix

* **Deploy to Gitpod first.** Prefix `https://gitpod.io#` before your GitHub/GitLab repo link, sign in when prompted and volia!
* **Code anyway** Code, edit, commit, push, pull, merge, etc.
* **Update `origin` to your fork.** Open the console and run `git remot set-url origin <your-target-git-url>`. Then fetch repo updates with `git fetch` then `git pull` and push with `git push`

## Recommendations
* Enable workspace sharing by clicking Your Profile Picture -> **Share Running Workspace** -> **Share**. Only share the link with the people you trust!
    The share link will looks like `https://abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ij-XXYYZZAABBCC.ws-ap01.gitpod.io/` where `abcdefgh-1234-5678-90ij-XXYYZZAABBCC` is unique string in every deploy.
* Montior your usage in https://gitpod.io/usage/ and upgrade if needed.
